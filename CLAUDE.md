### Current State

- **Production-ready system** with optimized form behavior and professional UX
- **Database Efficiency**: 19 legacy columns removed from profiles table - significantly streamlined schema
- **Training Types Integration**: Direct training type selection eliminates complex scheme mapping
- **Architecture Unification**: Complete transition to training_types system, no dual systems remaining
- **Code Quality**: Enhanced to 9.0/10 with clean, unified architecture and zero legacy references
- **Integration Status**: Both backend (localhost:4000) and frontend (localhost:3000) running successfully
- **‚úÖ Database Migration Complete**: All legacy columns successfully removed from MySQL database

### Critical Issues Remaining

- üö® **Session Management Security**: localStorage still in use at authService.ts:93-112 (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Component Naming**: avatarUser.tsx uses snake_case
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Button Duplication**: 6+ scattered button components
- ‚ùå **API Caching**: No React Query/SWR implementation

## Next Session Priorities (In Order)

1. **Security Fix**: Move session management from localStorage to HTTP-only cookies (authService.ts) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
2. **Component Consolidation**: Standardize naming and remove duplicates (Button components, file naming)
3. **Performance Optimization**: Add missing useCallback/useMemo and implement React Query/SWR
4. **Error Boundaries**: Complete React error boundary implementation
5. **Code Quality**: Clean up remaining ESLint warnings and unused variables

## Session Management Protocol

### IMPORTANT: Auto-Save Instructions for Claude

**These protocols are ACTIVE and should be followed automatically:**

1. **Regular Updates (Auto-Triggered)**:

   - Update CLAUDE.md at natural breakpoints during work
   - After completing major features or fixing significant issues
   - When priorities change or new discoveries are made
   - No user prompting required - do this proactively

2. **Save & Exit Command**:

   - When user says 'save and exit' ‚Üí immediately update CLAUDE.md with:
     - Final session summary
     - All completed tasks
     - Current status and next priorities
     - Any important context for continuation
   - Then acknowledge session end

3. **Continuity Requirements**:
   - Each session builds on previous work with full context
   - Always check CLAUDE.md first to understand current state
   - Follow the established action plan and priorities
   - Maintain the session history format

### NEW: Code Verification & Accuracy Protocols

4. **Mandatory Code Verification Protocol**:

   - Before marking ANY task as completed in CLAUDE.md, MUST verify actual implementation by reading relevant files
   - Use Glob + Read tools to confirm claimed features actually exist and work as described
   - Never rely solely on previous session reports - always verify against current codebase
   - Document specific file paths and line numbers when marking items complete
   - Example: "‚úÖ EmailField implemented - verified at src/components/formElements/EmailField.tsx:1-51"

5. **Task Completion Standards**:

   - ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**: Feature fully implemented, tested, and verified in codebase
   - üîÑ **PARTIAL**: Feature partially implemented, document what's missing specifically
   - ‚ùå **NOT STARTED**: No evidence of implementation found in codebase
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS VERIFICATION**: Claimed complete but requires code audit
   - üö® **INCORRECTLY CLAIMED**: Previously marked complete but verification shows incomplete
   - Use emoji indicators for quick visual status assessment

6. **Session Start Verification Protocol**:

   - At session start: Quick audit of last 2-3 "completed" items from previous sessions
   - Use Glob/Read tools to verify claimed completions before proceeding with new work
   - If discrepancies found, update status immediately with corrections
   - Prioritize verification of CRITICAL items (security, authentication, core functionality)

7. **Session End Verification Protocol**:

   - At session end: Verify all newly marked completions with actual file checks
   - Include file paths and line numbers as proof of completion
   - Create "Verification Log" section showing what was actually checked vs claimed
   - Never mark items complete without code evidence

8. **Inaccuracy Handling & Corrections**:

   - When discovering incorrect completion claims, document in "Session Corrections" section
   - Show before/after status with reasoning and evidence
   - Identify patterns in reporting errors to prevent future mistakes
   - Flag high-risk items (security, architecture) for mandatory re-verification in future sessions

9. **Risk-Based Verification Priority**:

   - **CRITICAL**: Security fixes, authentication, session management - ALWAYS verify with code inspection
   - **HIGH**: Type safety, API integrations, core functionality - Verify if time permits
   - **MEDIUM**: UI improvements, styling, performance optimizations - Sample verification
   - **LOW**: Documentation, minor refactoring - Trust previous reports if consistent

10. **Workflow Optimization Tracking**:
    - Track accuracy rate: Items claimed complete vs actually complete
    - Document time spent on verification vs new development
    - Identify patterns in over-reporting or under-reporting completions
    - Goal: Achieve >95% accuracy in completion claims
    - Use TodoWrite tool to track verification tasks during sessions
